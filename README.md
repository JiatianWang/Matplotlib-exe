Task1: Remove all the ticks (both axes), and tick labels on the Y axis.

Task2: Remove the frame of the chart.

Task3: Change the bar colors to be less bright blue, make one bar, the python bar, a contrasting color, soften all labels by turning grey.

Task4: Directly label each bar with Y axis values, and remove the Y label since bars are directly labeled.\
